<h3> Project:SSH Log Analysis using Splunk </h3>

<h3>Object</h3>
  The goal of this project is to analyze SSH authentication logs to detect:

  - Successful logins (who connected, from where)
  - Failed login attempts (possible brute-force or password spraying)
  - Multiple failed authentication attempts (indicators of brute-force)
  - Connections without authentication (potential scanning or incomplete sessions)
